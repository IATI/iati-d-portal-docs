The `d-portal Generator <https://d-portal.org/ctrack.html#view=generator>`_ is a tool to help users to reproduce IATI data in their own webpages or blogs.
It generates HTML code which you can copy into your webpage to create an IATI widget.

These widgets can show IATI data in table, graph, map, or list formats:

- Published by specific :iati-reference:`reporting-org`
- Describing funds a specific :iati-reference:`recipient-country`.

The resulting widget will update automatically overnight, in line with d-portal.

Both secured and non-secured HTTP access is supported by d-portal. This means users on secured domains should also be able to use d-portal Generator content.
