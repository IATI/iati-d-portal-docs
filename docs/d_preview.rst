`d-preview <http://d-preview.codeforiati.org/upload>`_ is a tool which generates a private preview of an IATI XML file. Using the same interface as d-portal, d-preview allows users to “proof-read” their IATI XML before publication.

Users can upload IATI XML from their computer, or use a link to a file to generate a preview. The link to this preview can also be shared with colleagues and stakeholders.

All previews are automatically deleted after ten days.
