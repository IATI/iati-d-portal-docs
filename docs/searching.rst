d-portal provides a search function which allows users to explore IATI data. This is made up of filters and a freetext box. As you build your search query, the number of filtered IATI activities will update.

Filters:
    The filters are based on elements of the `IATI Standard <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/>`_. You can select multiple filters using the dropdown menus. Clicking on “More Filters” displays a wider range of filters.

Freetext:
    The freetext search box searches against the `Title <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/title/>`_ and `Description <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/description/>`_ elements of IATI activities.

Once your search query is ready, you can click "Explore Results" to view the activities.
